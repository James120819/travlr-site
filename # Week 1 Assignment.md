# Week 1 Assignment

For this assignment, my MongoDB is working well along with structuring my files but I noticed that I was getting a lot of error and system reporting bugs "authentication failed" 

I also inputted my username along with password and the system would still give me errors. 

Within my project file, I have provided screenshots of my code along with the system reports.
