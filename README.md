# travlr-site
This is a travel booking web application project
Architecture

In this project, I worked with both traditional HTML and JavaScript using express for backend rendering and a modern single page application with angular for the frontend. While express HTML is good for fast rendering and simple routing, angular offers a dynamic user side experience with efficient data handling and reactivity. The backend used MongoDB, a NoSQL database, because it provides flexibility in data structure and scales well for dynamic travel data, especially with JSON style documents.

Functionality:

JSON is a data format, while JavaScript is a full programming language. I used JSON to structure and transmit data between the front end and backend. I also used JSON to make API calls that tied the two parts together. During the development of this project, I refactored the UI using Angular components, which allowed for reusable and more structured code like the trip listings and detail views.

Testing:

I used Postman to test various endpoints, including authentication with mock users. This ensured that routes requiring authentication were protected. By utilizing Postman for the first time with this project, I was able to conduct various tests. Testing the security added routes was more challenging because it was requiring me to include tokens in headers. By understanding methods and endpoints, this helped me secure the application against unauthorized access.

Reflection:

This course greatly enhanced my confidence in full stack development. Iâ€™ve learned how to integrate front end and backend technologies, manage RESTful APIs, and secure routes using tokens. I also learned how to pace myself when coding these projects. By pacing myself and not rushing the process, I will be able to build more efficient projetcs. These skills will help me not only have a better understanding of real world full stack development, but to also apply these skills towards building efficient applications.
